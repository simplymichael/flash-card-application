    # The touch .env is to create an empty .env file inside the nexjs app (flash-ssr) directory.
    # We don't need a .env file, but to avoid nextjs' warning that
    # it is unable to load a .env file, we create a .env file (if one doesn't exist)
    # If filename exists, only its modification and access times will be changed. Data will remain the same.
    # If filename does not exist, a zero-byte file will be created with the current time as the access and modification time.
    # And if you don't want to modify the access and modification times when the file (a regular file) exists, try:
    # [[ -f filename ]] || touch filename
